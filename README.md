# erc20-certificates

The ERC20Certificate smart contract is an extension of the ERC20 token standard with certificate functionality added. This allows coin admins/owners to distribute signed certificates to users without requiring an ethereum transaction. A certificate is redeemable for an amount of tokens determined by the admin who created and signed it.
